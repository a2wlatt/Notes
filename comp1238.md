## Week 1 - History of Writing & Text
- Early writing systems like cuneiform evolved from simple markings and were used to record information such as trade and numbers.
- Writing systems and number systems developed together, showing how humans structured information long before computers existed.

## Week 2 - Bits, Bytes & Memory
- Computers store all data using binary (bits: 0 and 1), and 8 bits form one byte, which can represent numbers or characters.
- There are two main types of memory: volatile memory (RAM, temporary) and non-volatile storage (SSD/HDD, permanent).

## Week 3 - Structure of Text in Computing
- Text in computers is stored as sequences of bytes, and structure (lines, spacing, indentation) helps humans and programs interpret it correctly.
- Markup languages like Markdown and HTML add structure and meaning to plain text files.

## Week 4 - Text Editors & Typing
- Plain text editors (like Vim or VS Code) are used for coding because they avoid hidden formatting found in word processors.
- Efficient typing and keyboard shortcuts improve productivity and make text manipulation faster.

## Week 5 - Command Line Interface (CLI)
- A CLI allows users to interact with a computer by typing commands instead of using a graphical interface.
- Basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `cat` help navigate directories and read file contents.
